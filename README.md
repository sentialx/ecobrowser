# Eco Browser

Eco Browser - save the world and resources by using a web browser without connection to the Internet.

# How it works?

Eco Browser doesn't connect to the Internet, hence it doesn't activate any 5G receivers which results
in less energy consumption and reducing the amount of critically dangerous microwaves for human health.
Disabling the Internet connection is one of the most important missions in order to make the world
better, healthier and stronger. Also, it doesn't do heavy computational operations like rendering external
content through the filesystem.

## Installation

[Downloads](https://github.com/sentialx/ecobrowser/releases)

Unfortunately, there is no way to install the browser without Internet connection, but once you will
have installed it on your machine, (which is also resource hungry, but don't be disappointed, we already
work on a browser which doesn't require booting up your computer) don't hesitate to disconnect from the Internet!

## Building

Although we don't recommend installing `node_modules` and running it in development mode, since it's really
power consuming (I have to admit, I did it once), but you can do it by yourself by installing Node.js and Yarn
and running the following command:

```
$ yarn && yarn start
```
